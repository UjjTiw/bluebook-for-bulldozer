# bluebook-for-bulldozer
Introduction:
--------------------
This project aims to develop a regression model using the RandomForestClassifier algorithm to predict the prices of bulldozers. The model is built to participate in a Kaggle competition focused on time series data analysis. The goal is to accurately estimate the sale prices of bulldozers based on historical data.

Data Source:
--------------------
The dataset used in this project is provided by Kaggle as part of the competition. It includes a comprehensive collection of features that describe various aspects of bulldozers, such as their specifications, usage history, and market conditions. The dataset is organized as a time series, enabling us to leverage temporal patterns for accurate price predictions.

Model Development:
--------------------
The regression model is implemented using the RandomForestClassifier algorithm. This algorithm is selected for its ability to handle complex relationships between features and target variables, as well as its effectiveness in handling time series data. The model is trained using historical bulldozer price data, and a rigorous cross-validation process is applied to optimize its performance.

Evaluation Metric:
--------------------
The performance of the model is assessed using an appropriate evaluation metric, such as Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE). This metric is chosen to account for the logarithmic nature of the target variable and to penalize larger prediction errors more severely. The lower the RMSLE score achieved by the model, the better its predictive accuracy.

Project Structure:
--------------------
The project is organized into the following sections:

1. Data Preprocessing: In this section, the dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and feature engineering tasks. Time series specific techniques, such as lag features and rolling statistics, are employed to capture temporal patterns.

2. Feature Selection: Relevant features are selected based on their importance and correlation with the target variable. Dimensionality reduction techniques, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), may also be applied to enhance model performance.

3. Model Training: The RandomForestClassifier model is trained on the processed data using appropriate training and validation strategies. Hyperparameter tuning techniques, such as grid search or random search, are employed to optimize the model's performance.

4. Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using the selected evaluation metric, such as RMSLE. The performance is assessed on both the training and validation datasets to ensure generalization.

5. Prediction and Submission: The trained model is utilized to make predictions on the test dataset provided by the Kaggle competition. The predicted bulldozer prices are submitted for evaluation on the competition platform.
